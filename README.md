Adding links will be done by using square brackets and also adding descriptions or titles to links when overed over:

A good browser/search engine is [Google](https://ww.google.com "here we write the description eg its so powerfull")

Another browser/search engine is [Bing](https://ww.bing.com "here we write the description eg its so powerfull")

adding an email address  or link is quite similar:

<https:www.example.com>

<yesyes@yesyes.yes>
